NOTE: this is currently a draft/experiment, and there are absolutely zero stability guarantees. This repo's format can and will evolve over time as we toy around with things. More explanation as to what this is may come in the future.

## Unanswered Questions

- Do we let every texture specify a default option (ie. in its manifest file)? or do we say, there are "technically" no such thing as a default option, you just declare default in a file `presets/default.wm` (name is arbitrary and only conventional) that the user then must include in the bottom as fallback?
