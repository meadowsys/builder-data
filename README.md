# Builder Data

NOTE: this is currently a draft/experiment, and there are absolutely zero stability guarantees. This repo's format can and will evolve over time as we toy around with things. More explanation as to what this is may come in the future.

## Unanswered Questions

- Do we let every texture specify a default option (ie. in its manifest file)? or do we say, there are "technically" no such thing as a default option, you just declare default in a file `presets/default.wm` (name is arbitrary and only conventional) that the user then must include in the bottom as fallback?

## Some misc details

This commit is the commit we will pin ourselves to when porting over the initial data, for consistency reason. After we're done with this initial version, we can update/backport to newer/older commits.
